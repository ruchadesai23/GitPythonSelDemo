#declare the scope to class in fixture
#to run testcases from any browser in runtime from command line
#command in CMD = py.test --browser_name firefox

to achieve the above inform pytest that we will be declaring command line arguments


utilities hold common codes which can be reused for multiple tests
eg. Baseclass
wait mechanism
select dropdown - using select keyword
